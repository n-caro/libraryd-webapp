## Change connectionString of Database (temporal solution)
**‚ö† This is a temporary solution **. We are working on a hotfix that will modify the connectionString on a single filesettings / fileconfig. ‚ö†

But meanwhile:
You need to **change the value of the connectionString** variable in **LibrarydDbContext.cs** (AcessData) and **ContainerBuilder.cs** (Presentation)
* For **LibrarydDbContext.cs**: Go to file libraryd-webapp/PSoft.Libraryd/PSoft.Libraryd.AcessData/LibrarydDbContext.cs , and change the value of the string connectionString (at line 12)
* For **ContainerBuilder.cs**: Go to file libraryd-webapp/PSoft.Libraryd/PSoft.Libraryd.Presentation/ContainerBuilder.cs , and change the value of the string connectionString (at line 24)
